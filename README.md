# Book Versions

This extension covers the needs for managing and publishing documentation (a collection of pages, called a book) 
that is:
- versioned (with version inheritance as well as unversioned content),
- described by a status,
- that can be conditioned by variants,
- in multiple languages,
- and using libraries of keywords/rich content dynamically filled in.

It aims at providing similar features as Scroll Versions extension for Confluence.
